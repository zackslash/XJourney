There is example data (ExampleData.csv) included in the src, follow that format when generating your own data.

Format:`Altitude,Latitude,Longitude,Course,HorizontalAccuracy,Lifespan,Speed,Timestamp,Type,VerticalAccuracy,`
Example:`9,50.863517,-1.169958,118,5,30,19.540001,1412580664.109,1,3,`


## Requirements

* Xcode 6.0 or later
* Xcode must be inside your 'Applications' directory and named 'Xcode'.
* If you downloaded Xcode from the appstore (and not the iOS dev portal) you need to give 'Everyone' read & write permissions to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreLocation.framework/Support/SimulationScenarios/`


## Build
This application was written using [Node-Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) to 'compile' run the build.sh script and the package in the 'output' dir will get updated.
